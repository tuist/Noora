<!-- MDOC !-->

Noora is a component library for building web applications with Phoenix LiveView. See all our components in our [Storybook](https://storybook.noora.tuist.dev)

## Installation

To start, add `noora` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
defp deps do
  [
    {:noora, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Additionally, you need to add the stylesheet and scripts to your own assets.
These come bundled with the package, so, assuming that you are using the default Phoenix setup, you can import them to your `assets/css/app.css` and `assets/js/app.js` files:

```css
/* assets/css/app.css */
@import "noora/noora.css";
```

```javascript
// assets/js/app.js
import Noora from "noora";

let liveSocket = new LiveSocket("/live", Socket, {
  // Your existing socket setup
  hooks: { ...Noora },
});
```

## Fonts

Noora uses the following fonts:

- **DM Sans** (weights 400, 500, 600) - Primary headings font
- **Geist Mono** (weights 400, 700) - Monospace font for code
- **Inter** / **InterVariable** (weights 100-900) - Body text font

Fonts are not included by default, giving you control over how they are loaded. You have two options:

### Option 1: Use the bundled fonts from CDNs

Import `fonts.css` before `noora.css` to load fonts from Google Fonts and rsms.me:

```css
/* assets/css/app.css */
@import "noora/fonts.css";
@import "noora/noora.css";
```

This is the simplest option but makes external requests to third-party CDNs.

### Option 2: Self-host fonts

For better performance, privacy, or to avoid external requests, self-host the fonts:

```css
/* assets/css/app.css */

/* Define your self-hosted font faces */
@font-face {
  font-family: "DM Sans";
  src: url("/fonts/DMSans.woff2") format("woff2");
  font-weight: 400 600;
  font-display: swap;
}

@font-face {
  font-family: "Geist Mono";
  src: url("/fonts/GeistMono.woff2") format("woff2");
  font-weight: 400 700;
  font-display: swap;
}

@font-face {
  font-family: "Inter";
  src: url("/fonts/InterVariable.woff2") format("woff2");
  font-weight: 100 900;
  font-display: swap;
}

/* Then import noora */
@import "noora/noora.css";
```

You can download the fonts from:
- [DM Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/DM+Sans)
- [Geist Mono](https://vercel.com/font)
- [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/)
